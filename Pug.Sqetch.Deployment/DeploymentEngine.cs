/// <summary>
/// Executes a bundle's deploy scripts in manifest order against a database, journaling every
/// event through the project's own SQL — carried in the bundle as
/// <see cref="JournalingStatements"/> and run by <see cref="StatementJournal"/> — and starting
/// after whatever the journal says is already deployed. Where that start lies follows from the
/// journal alone: nothing journaled
/// deploys the bundle whole, an <em>incompletely</em> deployed release resumes inside itself
/// (so the bundle must contain it), skipping the plans the journal already holds and deploying
/// the rest in bundle order, and a <em>completely</em> deployed release hands over to
/// whichever release depends on it — which may be a release the bundle does not contain,
/// making this a continuation bundle.
///
/// A deployment opens three kinds of transaction, in order. First the journal's own schema, from
/// the <see cref="JournalingSlot.PrepareJournal"/> slot, committed alone: it must exist before the
/// journal can be read, and DDL auto-commits on some engines, which would implicitly end a
/// transaction shared with anything else. Then both journal queries together, so the resume
/// decision is made from one consistent view rather than two independent round trips. Then the
/// deployment itself, committed at plan or release boundaries per
/// <see cref="DeploymentCommitLevel"/>; a release's completion is always journaled in the
/// same transaction as its last plan. On failure the open transaction is rolled back and
/// the failure rethrown — earlier boundary commits stand.
///
/// Note for the rollback work: rolling a deployment back cannot be "roll back the open
/// transaction", because a maintainer will be able to ask for rollback regardless of commit level
/// and the earlier boundary commits are already durable. It has to be a compensating path that
/// runs the rollback scripts of what this run deployed, in reverse, and journals it through the
/// <c>RollingBack*</c>/<c>RolledBack*</c> slots — which is why transaction bookkeeping here is
/// kept separate from any record of what was deployed.
