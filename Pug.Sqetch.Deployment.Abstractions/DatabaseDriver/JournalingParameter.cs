/// Never null. Today it is a non-null <see cref="string"/> for every parameter except
/// 'utcTimestamp', which is a <see cref="DateTime"/> with <see cref="DateTimeKind.Utc"/> — a
/// timestamp is passed as one rather than as text because no provider implicitly casts text to a
/// timestamp column, and formatting it would make every maintainer cast it back in SQL.
