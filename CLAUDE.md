# Pug.Sqetch

DevOps database schema upgrader. A **project** contains **plans** (units of schema change),
each plan contains **steps** with three SQL scripts (`deploy.sql`, `verify.sql`,
`rollback.sql`). Plans are grouped into **releases** that form a single linear lineage: every
release except the first names exactly one predecessor (`Dependency`), and a release may have
at most one dependant. Finalizing a release freezes it and its plans. The `bundle` command
packages deployable plans plus a manifest for deployment pipelines; the separate
**sqetch-deploy** CLI consumes those bundles and deploys them to a database through
pluggable database drivers, journaling through SQL the project maintainer authors.

## Commands

## Architecture rules

- **Layering**: the store filters, the engine orders, the CLI presents. Ordered read APIs
  (`GetReleases`, `GetPlans`, `GetSteps`) return dependency-chronological order — never
  re-sort downstream. Only the CLI may use `ProjectPaths` (for printing paths).
- **Storage is git-legibility-first**: state changes move folders (plan → release folder on
  assignment; release → its shard on finalization). Only *finalized* releases are sharded;
  unfinalized ones live at `releases/<name>/`. `ReleaseDirectory` probes both locations —
  never scan `releases/` (the plan index and `EnumerateReleaseDirectories` exist for that).
- **Journaling statements are project-level and not frozen**: they live in `journaling/` at the
  project root, written atomically like every other store file, and — unlike step scripts — have no
  finalized-release guard, so they can change after a release is finalized while an already-built
  bundle keeps the SQL it was built with. `ProjectPaths` owns the paths and
  `JournalingSlots.FileName` the names, so the store and the bundle layout cannot drift apart.
- **`plan-index` is derived data**: plan.json files and folder locations are the source of
  truth; the index is rebuildable (`sqetch project reindex`).
- **Pluggable families** (sharding strategies, bundle types, bundle layouts, database
  drivers): contracts in an `.Abstractions` project, implementations
  in sibling projects, a registry keyed by name (`OrdinalIgnoreCase`). Bundling and
  deployment registries ship **empty**; the host registers built-ins via the `Register*()`
  extension methods (see `BundleCommand`, `SqetchDeployApp.CreateDefaultRegistrar`).
  Journaling is deliberately *not* a family:
  the SQL is the project's, so there is nothing to select at deploy time and no
  `--driver`/`--journal` pair to mismatch.
- **Bundles are read through the same families**: `IBundleType.Open` returns an
  `IBundleReader` (archives extract to a temp dir deleted on dispose); `IBundleLayout`
  translates its on-disk manifest schema to/from the layout-neutral `BundleManifest`
  (`ReadManifest`) and owns entry pathing (`ScriptPath`). Manifest array order IS the
  deployment order.
- **Bundles carry the release lineage**: every manifest release records its `dependency` (the
  release it follows; empty starts the lineage), and a bundle's releases must form a
  contiguous chain — a manifest omitting `dependency` normalizes it to the preceding release,
  since array order is already the contract. `bundle --since <release>` emits a *continuation
  bundle* holding only the releases after the named one.
- **Journaling is project-authored SQL** (`JournalingSlot`, `JournalingStatements` in
  `Pug.Sqetch.Models`): fifteen slots — twelve deployment events, the two queries
  `GetLatestRelease`/`GetDeployedPlans`, and `PrepareJournal` — set per project via
  `IProject.SetJournalingStatement`, stored as `journaling/<slot>.sql`, and carried in the bundle.
  A slot may hold several statements, separated by a line whose trimmed content is exactly `;;`;
  that is the **only** parsing Sqetch does to the SQL, so a `$$ … $$` body containing a bare `;;`
  alone on a line would split wrongly. Query slots hold exactly one statement. Parameters are
  supplied by name without a provider prefix (`@project` on every slot, plus `@release`, `@plan`,
  `@step`, `@description` as the slot carries them, and `@utcTimestamp` last on every *writing* slot
  — see `JournalingSlots.ParameterNames`/`Writes`); binding is the driver's job and Sqetch never
  scans SQL for placeholders, so a statement that names none of them is fine. `@utcTimestamp` is the
  deployment host's clock, bound as a `DateTime` with `DateTimeKind.Utc` rather than text (no
  provider implicitly casts text to a timestamp column) and read **once per journaled event**, not
  per statement. It exists for the engine that cannot supply the instant itself; a maintainer whose
  engine can is better served by `now()`, which no skewed host clock can disorder. Deliberately
  absent: an actor (`current_user`). Queries and `PrepareJournal` get no timestamp — one filters on
  identity, the other is DDL that records no event. `bundle` refuses until all fifteen are set, naming every missing one;
  rollback slots are required even though rollback deployment is not implemented.
  CLI: `sqetch journaling list [--statements] [-o <FORMAT>]`, `parameters [<slot>] [-o <FORMAT>]`
  (answers from the contract alone, so it needs no project), `print <slot>` (verbatim, no markup,
  so `> file.sql` round-trips) and `set <slot>` taking exactly one of an SQL argument, `--file` or
  `--stdin`. SQL beginning with `--` cannot be passed as the argument — a leading-dash positional
  parses as an option — so a comment-first statement needs `--file` or `--stdin`.
- **Query result contracts** (`StatementJournal`): read by **ordinal**, first N columns are the
  contract and extras are ignored — Oracle folds unquoted identifiers, and `GetOrdinal`'s case
  sensitivity is provider-defined. `GetLatestRelease` returns zero or one row (column 0 release
  name, column 1 completed); more than one row throws, and a NULL release name throws rather than
  being coerced, because `""` already means the pseudo-release. `completed` coerces from bool,
  any numeric (`!= 0`), or `1/y/yes/t/true` case-insensitively. Failures are
  `JournalingStatementException` naming the slot and the 1-based statement within it.
- **Deploy semantics** (`DeploymentEngine`): the journal alone decides where deployment starts,
  in four branches — nothing journaled deploys the bundle whole; an **incompletely** deployed
  release must be *contained* in the bundle and resumes inside it; a **completely** deployed
  release hands over to whichever group *depends* on it, which may be a release the bundle does
  not contain (continuation bundle). `deployedPlans` resumes inside the journaled group,
  skipping the plans it **names** and deploying the rest in bundle order (and journaling that
  release's completion when none are left, without journaling its start again); the journaled
  group alone starts at the group depending on it; neither starts at the first group — refusing
  when the first group has a dependency. `GetLatestRelease` returns `JournaledRelease?`
  (`null` = fresh database, `Name == ""` = the unreleased-plans pseudo-release, `Completed` = its
  `ReleaseDeployed` was journaled) and `GetDeployedPlans` is an **unordered set** — resume is by
  membership, never by position, because a release's plans are only partly ordered (disjoint
  dependency chains can be interleaved either way, and the journal records nothing that pins
  which interleaving a past run used). A journaled plan the bundle's copy of the release lacks is
  `IncompatibleBundleException`. The pseudo-release depends on the bundle's last real release,
  so it is an ordinary link in the chain; nothing may depend on *it*, so a database left at the
  pseudo-release is refused rather than matched to a lineage-starting bundle. A completed
  release is never resumed into, so plans a bundle gained for one are not deployed — test
  databases are single-use. Re-deploying an unchanged bundle is `NothingToDeploy`, not an error.
  Mismatches are `IncompatibleBundleException` (the bundle is well formed but does not fit the
  database's state); `InvalidBundleException` stays for malformed manifests.
- **Transaction order** (`DeploymentEngine`): every deployment opens `PrepareJournal` in a
  transaction committed **alone** (the journal's schema must exist before it can be read, and DDL
  auto-commits on some engines), then **both** journal queries in one transaction (so the resume
  decision comes from one consistent view), then the deployment itself — committed at plan or
  release boundaries per `DeploymentCommitLevel`, with `ReleaseDeployed` always journaled in the
  same transaction as the release's last plan. Neither the prepare nor the read commit is reported
  to `IDeploymentListener`: they are not deployment progress. On failure the open transaction rolls
  back — earlier commits stand.
- **Rollback is compensating, not transactional** (`DeploymentRollbackMode`, `deploy --rollback`):
  `on-error` undoes what the run committed after a failure, `on-success` undoes a deployment that
  worked — for proving a bundle applies cleanly, usually a test bundle, though a bundle of
  finalized releases is not refused: what a caller wants to prove and then undo is its own
  business. It runs each step's `rollback.sql` in reverse (releases, then plans, then steps) and
  journals through the `RollingBack*`/`RolledBack*` slots. It is **independent of
  `DeploymentCommitLevel`**, which is the whole point: at plan level the earlier plans are already
  durable and no database transaction could take them back. The engine therefore records committed
  units — a plan moves from pending to committed only when its transaction commits, so a plan the
  open transaction took back is never compensated for a change that never reached the database. A
  failing rollback script throws `RollbackFailedException` and replaces the failure that triggered
  it: a half-compensated database is worse than either end state, and the reason was already
  reported to the listener. The standalone `sqetch-deploy rollback` command is still a stub;
  rollback today is a mode of `deploy`.
- **Database drivers are ADO.NET wrappers, not SQL translators**: `AdoDatabaseDriver` holds the
  connection, the transactions on it and the command plumbing; a provider project supplies only a
  connection factory and a factory implementing `IDatabaseDriverFactory`. Journaling parameters are
  bound **by their bare name, all of them**, including the ones a statement never mentions —
  verified per provider, since neither behaviour can be read off a provider's documentation
  (Npgsql ignores an unreferenced parameter despite rewriting named placeholders to positional
  ones, and both providers resolve a prefixless name against every placeholder form they accept).
  A provider needing the prefix spelled out, or refusing what it cannot see, belongs in
  `AdoDatabaseTransaction.Bind` *with a test proving the need* — an earlier dialect-plus-SQL-scan
  for exactly that was deleted once the probe showed no provider needed it.
  **One connection per driver**, opened on first use and reused: a deployment's transactions are
  strictly sequential, and session state a maintainer's statements set up survives between them. A
  second overlapping transaction is refused as a bug. `IDatabaseDriver` is `IDisposable` because it
  owns that connection, and disposing it **rolls back** an open transaction rather than committing
  it; `DeployCommand` owns the lifetime. The step script timeout applies to step scripts alone —
  a journaling statement waiting on a lock is left to the provider's default. A query's `DbCommand`
  outlives its reader (disposing the command closes the reader), so both are released when the
  journal disposes the reader or the transaction ends.
- **`sqetch-deploy drivers` answers from the registry alone** (`drivers list`, `drivers parameters
  [<driver>]`), so unlike every other command it needs neither a bundle nor a database — which is
  the point: whoever is reaching for a driver name has neither to hand yet. `parameters` prints the
  **required sets first and the per-parameter descriptions after**, because required-ness is a fact
  about *sets* (`[["host","database"],["connection-string"]]`) and nothing per-parameter can express
  it — a column marking each one required or not would turn a choice between two ways of connecting
  into seven independent flags. Switches are shown as a caller types them (`--postgres-host`), the
  way `journaling parameters` shows `@project`. A driver with no required sets still gets an empty
  sets section, so the result's shape does not depend on what it finds. Because `StrictParsing` is
  off app-wide, both commands must call `RemainingArguments.RejectAll` — without it a typo'd option
  lands in `IRemainingArguments` and the command reports success. Listing every driver constructs
  every factory, since `GetParametersDefinition` is an instance method; harmless while factories are
  connectionless, but a factory doing real work in its constructor would do it merely to be listed.
  A bare `sqetch-deploy drivers` prints the branch help and exits `1`, which is Spectre's own
  behaviour for a branch without a command (`sqetch journaling` does the same) rather than a code
  this CLI chose.
- **`sqlite` driver**: `--sqlite-file <PATH>` (created if missing) or `--sqlite-connection-string`,
  mutually exclusive. Pass `Mode=ReadWrite` in a connection string to refuse a missing file, which
  is how a mistyped path is caught.
- **`postgres` driver**: `--postgres-host` and `--postgres-database` (plus `port`, `username`,
  `password`, `password-env`), or `--postgres-connection-string`, which *replaces* them rather than
  extending them. `password-env` names an environment variable holding the password, since a command
  line is readable by every process on the host. Journaled instants arrive as `timestamptz`; a
  `timestamp` column would store whatever the session time zone made of them.
- **Both engines run DDL inside a transaction**, so a release deployed at release commit level
  really is all-or-nothing on them — the engines that commit DDL implicitly are what make the
  compensating rollback necessary, not these.
- **Driver tests run against real databases**: SQLite in temp files (never `:memory:`, whose
  contents die with the connection), PostgreSQL in a Testcontainers container gated by
  `[DockerFact]`/`[DockerTheory]`, which *skip* where the daemon socket cannot be reached rather
  than failing. `RealDatabaseDeployment` holds the end-to-end scenarios so both providers run the
  same ones — the only place the engine's resume decision is read back out of SQL the deployment
  itself wrote, and the only check that a journal's `completed` column works as both a count
  (SQLite) and a boolean (PostgreSQL). Compensating rollback is among them: that a committed plan is
  undone by its own `rollback.sql`, that `on-success` undoes releases and their plans in reverse,
  and that a failing rollback script leaves no half-finished compensation behind — the last of which
  only a real server can show, since it turns on the compensation transaction rolling its journal
  rows back with it.
- **Both CLIs present through one writer**: `Pug.Sqetch.Cli.Common` owns the `-o|--output` contract
  (`OutputSettings`, `OutputFormat`) and `ResultWriter` — JSON, CSV, a Spectre table on an
  interactive console and header-less tab-separated rows when piped. It is the only project the two
  CLIs share, and its types are public because two assemblies consume them. The CSV quoting, the
  JSON options and the interactive-vs-piped decision are exactly what drifts when duplicated, and
  `Pug.Sqetch.Deployment.Cli` must not reference `Pug.Sqetch.Cli` — that would drag the engine and
  the stores into a CLI that deliberately ships without the authoring side. **The machine formats
  are written with wrapping widened out of the way**: Spectre wraps to the profile width, which is
  80 whenever stdout is not a terminal — precisely when those formats are used — and a wrapped line
  is a corrupt record, not an ugly one: the newline lands inside a tab-separated field, a quoted CSV
  cell or a JSON string, where it is an invalid control character. `WriteSections` renders a result
  made of several tables (a set of groupings, then the things grouped): one JSON document, one CSV
  block per section keyed by the section's name, and piped rows prefixed with that key, since
  header-less rows from two sections are otherwise indistinguishable. `Pug.Sqetch.Tests.Cli.Common`
  pins all of it against a deliberately narrow, non-interactive console.
- **`sqetch-deploy` exit codes are categorized** (`DeployExitCodes`, public because they are the
  contract a pipeline reads): the tens digit names the category and the units digit the failure
  within it, so a caller can branch on a decade without knowing every member. A units digit of `0`
  is the category's *unspecified* code, reserved so adding a specific code never renumbers an
  existing one; a *one-digit* code means unclassified, and `1` is still what an unrecognized
  exception returns, so a `!= 0` test is unaffected. `0` covers deployed, nothing-to-deploy and
  deployed-then-undone alike — anything non-zero stops a `set -e` shell, and telling the three
  apart is the output's job. `10` is every command-line mistake, deliberately undivided: finer
  codes would mean parsing Spectre's message text or re-implementing its parser, and
  `CommandParseException` carries no reason of its own. Then `21`/`22`/`23` missing / invalid /
  incompatible bundle, `31`/`32`/`33` unknown driver / driver creation / database unreachable, `41`/`42`/`43` journal
  prepare / query / write, `51`/`52` deployment failed with the database unchanged / left partway,
  `61` rollback failed, `91` not implemented. Two precedence rules carry the operational meaning:
  a half-compensated database (`61`) outranks the failure that started the rollback, and a database
  left partway (`52`) outranks the cause of it — the cause stays in the message for whoever fixes
  it, the code tells a pipeline whether it may retry. `52` therefore needs to know whether anything
  committed, which only `DeployCommand` does, so **it returns its own code** and the central
  `SetExceptionHandler` sees only what was raised before the deployment began. `UnknownBundleType`
  is `10`, not `22` — the only bundle type name is the one `--bundle-type` carries; an unknown
  *layout* is `1`, since that name is the host's own constant. `33` exists because a driver is
  configured without connecting: an unreachable server is not a creation failure and does not
  surface until the first transaction, so `AdoDatabaseDriver` turns a failed open into
  `DatabaseConnectionException` rather than letting a provider exception reach the handler as `1`.
- **Names** (`NameRules` in the FileSystem store, surfaced early via CLI `NameValidation`):
  letters, digits and `-_+()@#.`; must start with a letter or digit, must not end with `.`,
  max 128 chars. Names become path segments and git paths.
- **`GetStepScripts` ownership**: the engine returns open streams the caller must dispose,
  and throws `MissingStepScriptsException` when a script file is missing;
  `VerifyStepScripts( plan )` checks a whole plan.

## Conventions

- Tabs for indentation; spaces inside parentheses: `Foo( bar, baz )`; file-scoped namespaces.
- Exceptions: plain classes with get-only properties and an optional message via `base(...)`
  (see `UnknownPlanException`); mapped to friendly CLI messages in `CliErrors.Describe`,
  surfaced by the central `SetExceptionHandler` in `SqetchApp` with exit code 1.
- Tests: xunit. sqetch CLI tests drive the real command tree through `CommandAppTester` and
  switch the process-wide current directory — every test class that does so must join
  `[Collection( "cli" )]` to stay sequential. sqetch-deploy CLI tests instead pass absolute
  paths and inject fakes via the production `TypeRegistrar` (`CommandAppTester( registrar )`),
  so they need no collection. Store/engine tests build on `TempProject`,
  `TestData` and `ShardingCases` from `Pug.Sqetch.Tests.Stores.FileSystem/TestSupport.cs`;
  git legibility is asserted with real `git` via the `Git` helper.
- Verify changes with the full `dotnet test` plus, for user-visible behavior, a live CLI run
  in a temp directory (`project user`, `project init`, then the flow under test).
