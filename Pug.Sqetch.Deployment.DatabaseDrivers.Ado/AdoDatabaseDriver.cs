/// <summary>
/// The ADO.NET half of every driver: a connection, the transactions opened on it, and the command
/// plumbing underneath them. A provider-specific driver supplies a connection factory and inherits
/// the rest, so a fix to transaction or parameter handling lands in one place rather than once per
/// provider.
///
/// Parameters are bound by their bare name, which both providers so far resolve against every
/// placeholder form they accept, and all of them are bound whether the statement mentions them or
/// not, which both providers accept. A provider that needs the prefix spelled out, or that refuses a
/// parameter it cannot see, needs that handled here — with a test proving the need, since neither
/// behaviour can be guessed from a provider's documentation.
///
/// One connection, opened on first use and reused: a deployment's transactions are strictly
/// sequential — prepare, then the journal read, then the deployment itself — so there is never a
/// second one to serve, and session state a maintainer's statements set up (a search path, a PRAGMA)
/// survives from one transaction to the next.
